            <li>Prepare rice. see our recipe for boiled rice. 
            Leave rice to cool as it is easier to manage

            the cold rice with a fork before frying.</li>

            fry for a minute. Then add in the mushrooms and 
            peas. Fry for another 2-3 minutes. Once done, 
            place the vegetables in a dish and put to one 
            side.</li>
            <li>Next, pour beaten egg into wok, stirring constantly. 
            When egg has cooked a little into a scramble (about 
            a minute or two) add in the boiled rice and fry for 
            three minutes.</li>
            <li>Now add the vegetables back into the wok and incorporate 
            into the rice. Finally add salt, soy sauce and sesame
