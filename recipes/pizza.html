        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Today we are going to show you how to make authentic Neapolitan pizza!
           It is unlike anything you've eaten before. The dough is thin, the crust
           is soft and fluffy, it's an experience that will leave you craving for more.
        </p>
        <p>Before we get started there are some things you must be  aware of. First, you 
           should plan your pizza day well ahead, as this dough will need to rest overnight
           in the fridge and then grow at room temperature for 6 to 8 hours. You should 
           also have a wood burning pizza oven. But few people have those, so you should
           crank up your oven to it's highest temperature. And now for the ingredients!
           These will be enough for 6 pizzas.
        </p>

        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>Neapolitan pizza dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix a small amount of the 700ml (3cups) of water with 
                yeast.</li>
            <li>Set aside 100 grams (a bit less than 1 cup) of flour. Pour the rest of 
                the water in a large bowl and start slowly adding the rest of the flour. 
                Start by mixing with a (silicone)spatula and after the first batch of 
                flour has been mix in the water, pour in the yeast water.</li>
            <li>Keep adding flour and mixing. This should take about 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once all of the 900 grams (7 cups) of flour has been added, start working 
                the dough with your hand: lift a part of the dough from the side and place 
                it in the center of the dough. Turn the bowl slightly and repeat the 
                process. Keep lifting the dough and rotating the bowl for about 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add salt and continue for 2 minutes. Then, add oil and continue for another 
                2 minutes. The dough should now be smooth and well mixed. Set it aside for
                15-20 minutes, covered by a wet cloth.</li>
            <li>Pour some of the leftover flour on a working surface. Then, pour the dough
                on it. The next step requires that you gently press the dough into a
                rough rectangular shape. Then fold the dough by folding one side on the
                center of the dough and then repeat with the other side as well. Press
                the dough again, turn 90 degrees and fold again. Repeat this process for
                2 minutes. Cover the dough and let rest for another 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Repeat the previous step for 1 minute and let the dough rest for another
                20 minutes.</li>
            <li>After the dough has rested, cut it into six pieces of equal size. Shape
                them gently into balls and place each of them in a separate container 
                with some olive oil to prevent sticking. Close the containers well.</li>
            <li>Let the dough stay in room temperature for 2 hours, after which put them
                to rest in the fridge overnight. Take the dough back to room temperature 
                6-8 (preferably 8) hours before baking the pizza.</li>
            <li>When the long resting time has passed, the dough should be very airy and 
                have bubbles on it. Place some flour on plate, grab a ball of dough and 
                dip both sides of it in flour. Place on a baking paper and gently press 
                the dough with your fingers from the center towards the edges. Continue 
                until the base is very thin but leave some thicker crust. Add your choice 
                of topping and bake in the oven.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Pizza Margherita</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the mozzarella into slices the size of a finger. Then place them on a 
                plate and let them release excess moisture in the fridge. Preheat the oven 
                to 250-275°C (480-530°F).</li>
            <li>Crush the contents of the can of peeled tomatoes. You can do this by hand, 
                squeezing the tomatoes, or in a food processor for only a few seconds. Add 
                salt and mix.</li>
            <li>Spread some tomato sauce on a prepared pizza dough. Add pieces of fresh 
                basil leaves on the sauce.</li>
            <li>Cook the pizza in the oven for a minute or two. When you see the pizza dough 
                starting to cook, take it out.</li>
            <li>Place some mozzarella slices evenly on the pizza. Sprinkle with some olive 
                oil. Put the pizza back in the oven and cook for 4-6 minutes, until the pizza 
                looks cooked from the crust.</li>
        </ol>
